# About the Repo
 A Repo for all the Deep learning concepts coded in python along with references: 
@Liana-pog and I(@CoughManCoding) are trying to replicate the concepts of deeep learning, coded in python.
Here is the flow of the project ->
1. Neural Networks (Basic - ANN)
2. Building RNN - GRU - LSTM
3. Coding Optimizers usually needed in deep learning frameworks
4. Building an Encoder
5. Gen-NLP-Encoder Transformer from scratch
6. VISION - Transformers
7. building a basic bigram / LLM
8. Finetuning LLMS
9. Nano + Shakespeare Gpt
10. VectorDB
11. Rag
12. Langchain
13. Lang Graph

Requirements
We will be using Scikit (not scipy), Pyspark, PyTorch (avoiding Tensorflow to a large extent), Neo4j, DataBricks as and when needed, Heruko or Streamlit for Assignment 9th.

Final Outcome:
At the end Our Main goal is to work on a Vision-transformer, given the expertises of @Liana-pog in computer vision, and mine in HCI. This project is intended to start September 10th.

Note:
1. We have made an concerted effort to loop or atleast refer all the sources, and you can find them under a docstring, at the starting of the notebook.
2. This code is free to use, since its all public information. (If possible, please connect before doing so, or simply drop me a ping on my email - siddharthsohansharma@gmail.com)
